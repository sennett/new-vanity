`grunt buildProd` to get a production-ready deployment package.  `grunt dev` to build and set watchers on a dev environment locally.

Todo:

- fix background colour bug in firefox 
- source maps for uglified code in production build
- get that nice font back
- text resize to fit available space on blurb and contact
- fix nasty rendering jump on images
- delay hover effect (add class using JS delay or something - CSS :hover is too keen)
- fix expanded activities so they don't go below the viewport
- have the new position of the expanded activity more relevant to the unfocused activity position - currently they all do the same thing
