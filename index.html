          			Work included maintaining the customer-facing site (with close collaboration with the graphic-design team), working on backend systems, and maintaining existing integrations.  Worked with LAMP/MAMP, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a load-balanced environment.  Also provided technical support for the company's bespoke backend systems, including Netsuite, Exchange (later Google Apps) and the Avaya phone system.  Very much a one-man tech dept. position.

      	  			Began as traditional .NET development work with web, database, WPF, and data integration projects.  I provided customer-facing advice and solutions as part of Enlighten's Rapid Response initiative, handling client engagement from inception and planning, through implementation and on to invoicing and signoff, and honing and documenting Enlighten's internal business processes as part of this work.

      	  			After a year I was promoted, and began outsourcing as a developer and technical liaison for an agile team implementing a service oriented architecture (SOA) for a large farm-automation and genetics company.  Day-to-day duties include TTD of JavaScript front end code for robust UI composition, web APIs, Windows Services and websites; maintenance of the continuous-release platform; investigating and implementing solutions to the complex technical challenges that arise from distributed computing concerns; regular meetings with business stakeholders to align goals and provide support and technical perspective; maintaining the relationship between Enlighten and the company to foster future collaboration.
